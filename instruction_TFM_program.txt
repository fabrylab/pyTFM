installation on windows

#### if any step fails, please consult me; the installation process is very error prone ######

1) get python anaconda
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
select installation only for your user
make sure to select "Add Anaconda to my PATH environmental variable"

update packages to the latest verisons:
go to a terminal and enter
conda update conda

2) install further python packages 

2.1) particle image velocimetry packages
get Microsoft Visual C++ build tools
download the installer
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16
execute the installer
select C++ build tools and install
(requires reboot)

then install the python packages by opening a terminal and typing
pip install openpiv==0.20.8

# finite elements analysis
pip install solidspy

# my python package

go to the tracktion_force_microscopy folder in the file I send you. 
copy it somewhere on your computer
open a terminal and enter:
pip install -e path_to_the_tracktion_force_microscopy_folder
# linux: sudo python -m pip install -e path_to_folder


3) get  clickpoints
for general instructions and a documentation on clickpoints go to 
https://clickpoints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#windows-installer
open a terminal and enter
pip install clickpoints
then
clickpoints register

(if you get an error here try 
conda update conda to fix it)
check if clickpoints by right clicking on any image file and opening it with clickpoints


4) ad my clickpoints addon
copy the folder TFM_addon that I send you into the addons folder of clickpoints. For me
the folder is located at C:\Users\Kerbe\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\clickpoints\addons

5) starting the programm
Maybe I show you the rest via skype ???....

## what the programm currently does:
calcualtes Deformation, Traction forces (btw you should use the hight correction version). You can draw in boundaries of cells. 
These boundaries can be used to calculate contractile force,contractile energy and intra cellular stresses. Contractile force adn energy
are saved to an out.txt file
####

go to the example folder I send you. As you can see you need 3 images (2 images of the beads and one of the membrane, or a bright field image...)
with a number at the beginning. You need to execute the script from build_data_base.py within the folder of the images(!) to arange   your images into a suitable data base. 

You can activate an addon by clicking on the button in the middle right. Then activate TFM_addon, then you have to open the addon window by clicking on the button 
that just appeared. Images ar sorted into layers and frames. Change frames by left and right arrows and change layers by the "image up/down key".
Newly calculated plots might not appear if you don't go to settings and disable "Thread image load" and "Thread image display". Also you might need to change 
layers for a new image to appear (might fix this soon).
To draw boundaries press F2 and use the tools in the upper right corner.





older:
# get pip (a tool for instalations of python packages)
see https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/ for instructions
download (by right click, then download) this python script
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
open a terminal "as Adminstrator"(!!) and enter
python Donwloads\get-pip.py 

1.1) make python command usable for the cmd console
(check if this is not the case already by openeing a console and typing python)
open an explore-> right click on "This PC"--> properties -->advanced system settings
--> environment Variables --> (in the first box) select Path --> press edit--> press new
--> enter the path to the folder containing the python.exe file, this is 
"C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3" for me--> ok.
confirm this is working
