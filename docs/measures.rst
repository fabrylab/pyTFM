Typical Measures for Force Generation and Stresses in Cells
===============================================================
There is a number of diffrent ways to measure force generation and stresses. Here you can find
an overview of all quantities that can be calculated with this program.

Deformations in the Substrate
-------------------------------
The simplest way is to sum up all deformations on the substrate surface that the cells are attached to.
The deformations depend on the mechanical properties of the substrate, which means that this is not
possible to compare results, when diffrent substrates have been used.

Strain Energy
-----------------
The strain energy is the total work that cells have put in (fromul) to deform their substrate. It is
defined as :math:`\frac{1}{2} \int \vec{d} \times \vec{t}`
